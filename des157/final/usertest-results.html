        <h1>User Testing Results</h1>
        <h2>Understanding Familiar Game Design</h2>
        <p>
            Something that I have noticed throughout the testing of my game in feedback sessions
            and in user testing is that not everyone will always be familiar with the conventional
            game tropes/design characteristics. For example one of my users was not familiar with
            top down games, so walking around was not immediately intuitive and may have looked like
            my character was floating. After explaining it was intentional they were quickly able to
            understand the game choices. Another common thing that was commented by multiple people 
            was that the health bars could be placed underneath each character rather than to the 
            side of them, since it could be confusing which health bar corresponds to which character.
            To someone like myself, who has been familiar with this design, it is almost second nature 
            to immediately understand the layout, however I can definitely understand how to someone 
            not familiar with the genre would experience some confusion.
        </p>
        <h2>Making Instructions More Visible</h2>
        <p>
            Some feedback that I received was that the game instructions could be better outlined
            or pointed out. While it wasn't difficult for the testers to find the game instructions,
            I can see how changes in the font-size or and outline would significantly improve the
            identifying of the game instructions. Some othere suggestions were changing the font-color
            to make it stand out or adding some sort of outline or overlay. An outline in combination
            with bigger font will most likely be the solution I will take, furthermore doing it this way
            will also follow the same way that the Pokemon game's solve this problem as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Improvements To Design</h2>
        <p>
            Other feedback that I received related mostly to design improvements. One good tip I received was that it was hard
            to tell whether the sound effects were currently in mute or unmute mode, so changing the text depending on
            the mode would be helpful to the user so they would be able to identify what mode it is in. I also received good tips on some better fitting colors and possibly
            adding a gameboy-like design to add to the overall aesthetic of the site which I agreed would look
            really nice. I'll definitely be finding ways to incorporate these helpful tips in order to improve
            the user interface.
        </p>
        <h2>Final Project Improvements</h2>
        <p>
            Based of the user testing results, there are a few key updates that I wish to implement. First off,
            I will be making the game instructions easier to identify and give good clear instructions. I think
            this will benefit all users, however most importantly help address those users who aren't as
            familiar with these types of games and their format. Furthermore, I may add color coding to the health bars
            to help users match them to their character. I'll also be updating my mute button to help users identify
            whether the music is currently muted or unmuted and I'll also be refining the color scheme to make it match
            a little more. Then if I still have time, I will be adding a few images to make the site look like
            an actual gameboy screen.
