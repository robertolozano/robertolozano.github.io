        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I will be updating my Studio 3 Project. I will be redesigning Interaction
            a game that follows my journey through college and the struggles that I
            encountered along the way in a sillier Pokemon style battle game. I decided
            on this topic as I am about to graduate and move on from my life as an undergrad,
            and bringing to life the obstacles and hurdles I encountered as Pokemon-like battles,
            will give me a nice look back at everything I've overcome.

            <p> 
                The website I used for Comparison 1 is the site for the game blockrage.
                The site uses a great combination of real world elements such as the 
                retro computer, the desk, and the books, which contrast greatly with the
                simpler retro looks on the monitor. I think it adds a really nice touch
                to the overall design.
                <br><br>

                Furthermore I feel they do a really great job with their pixel/retro art
                and include lots of great animations and user interactions such as their
                character selection mode, which is something I wish to incorporate in my
                project and they also use hover animations to help with picking from their
                selection menu.

            <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>

            <p>
                The website that I used for Comparison 2 is the site for the game chocapic.
                The site, much like comparison also uses this combination of real world elements
                by having a gameboy and an inner display where the game actually takes place.
                <br><br>
                This game also follows the retro/pixelated style and uses lots of great animations
                and user interactions. The one that stands out to me most are the keyboard interactions
                and animations that come with them. For example pressing "c" allows the character to
                make an actions and the "c" button on the gameboy also makes an animation. This stands out
                to me as this is something that I want to incorporate into my final project for when
                the user selects a level.

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                For interactions, I plan to use animations(ex: attacks, or sprite animations),
                hover animations(button selection), keyboard interaction (moving between levels).
            </p>

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                I plan to go with a very retro and pixelated design for this project.
                Since my project will be following this Pokemon-style format, I feel
                that the 8-bit retro style will fit it perfectly. My colors will follow
                a wide array of vivid colors as is common in Pokemon-style games. Furthermore,
                I will be incorporating a lot of sprite art.

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>
                The goals that I have for this project is to expand my skills in Design
                and put together everything that I have learned this quarter to create
                something great. I wish to expand on my ability with animations, overlays,
                and get out my comfort zone and use the HTML Canvas feature.
            </p>

            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>
                The intended experiences I am hoping to convey to the audience
                viewing my project is to see and join me in my journey throughout college.
                I feel that the audience getting to play through each step of my path, will
                help in achieving this as the audience gets to join me and partake in those
                same steps in a fun and engaging manner.
