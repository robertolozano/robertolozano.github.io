                ames have become a very normal part of our lives and things such as menus, popups, or button placement 
                aren't really things that one considers too important. However, in their article "Game Design UX Best 
                Practices", Amir Dori, goes on to share his vast experience in game design, after having designed 250+ 
                games and shares how extremely important these elements are and all the thought that goes into it. 
                Amir covers a wide array of topics such as store dialog, rate us dialogs, draggable objects, sliders, 
                menus, and positioning of elements on the screen. However, the common theme that stood out to me which 
                really surprised me because I had not really noticed until now was that the buttons placed in more 
                comfortable and easy to reach zones of the screen are the ones that benefit the app most, such as stores, 
                rating, or ads. Since these are placed in easier to reach locations then they are more likely to be clicked 
                on. From this, you can see how the placement is very intentional and not by accident at all. Amir also 
                points out the way in which this skirts the line of being dark UI, however, Amir also gives good advice 
                on making sure that the transactions are a win-win situation such as making sure the video rewards are 
                actually useful to the player, thus never completely taking advantage of the user.

                    </figure>
                    <p>I chose this image as it is one of the images that I found most interesting 
                        from my collection that I will be using. I don't believe that alone the image
                        is immediately interesting. At the end of the day it is just a picture of a shoe.
                        However I believe that if you were to take a closer look and notice the smaller details
                        you would be able to get a closer look into the mind of shoe collectors
                        such as myself who become enamored with what is otherwise just another
                        ordinary shoe. Everything from the silohuette of the shoe, to the stitching, to the 
                        designers own take on the swoosh, to the felt lining on the toebox tells a bigger story
                        about the history of the shoe and the people who decide to wear those shoes, which is my 
                        goal in this Every Picture project.
                        <br><br>
                        This image relates to the topic of my archive because it is one of many sneakers in my collection
                        that I wish to show in order to talk about why I enjoy collecting sneakers and what it is 
                        that I love about this particular silohuette.
                        <br><br>
                        This collection will tell the story of my own personal interests in sneakers to the history 
                        that this particular silohuette has had in culture, from its start in basketball
                        to its current presence in sneaker culture.

                    <p>This image is about London and Mystery (possibly Sherlock Holmes) 
                        <br><br>
                        The most interesting aspects of this image are the pieces laying on top of
                        the map. The map itself gives you lots of info about London being an important
                        part, however the pieces laying about add more mystery to the image. They all seem to
                        relate to the topic of mystery and/or Sherlock Holmes.
                        <br><br>
                        The most obvious aspects as I said is the London map. The more mysterious aspects
                        are the artifacts on top which hint at something more mysterious (quite literally).

                <h3 id="author">Michael Gonchar</h3>
            </div>
            <p><span class="first_letter">C</span>
                uriosity is powerful. This is something that Gonchar drives home in their article "10 Intriguing 
                Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills", where Gonchar lays out the importance 
                of digging deeper and exploring all the tiny details. By doing this, one is able to learn a lot more 
                about the world and extrapolate information that they would have otherwise missed. Thus Gonchar urges 
                the reader to be curious and always be seeking out new ideas and expanding their view of the world by 
                examining all the little details. 

                A site that I feel exemplifies this curiosity is the site by designer Virgil Abloh, <a href="https://public---domain.com/" class="blue">public---domain.</a> 
                On his site, he doesn't follow your typical layout for a website. Much like his designs, Virgil decides 
                to break what is considered the norm and decides to take his own spin on things. Instead it's set up like 
                a computer's desktop with all sorts of information being presented to you. You have all sorts of windows 
                open ranging from an interview to an image that links you to an article on Aya Brown. Furthermore, 
                since the website is set up like a desktop you can also explore the files on the computer, which invites 
                you to just explore through the wide array of images, videos, and files. Through that journey of discovery, 
                you get to take a peek into the early designs or inspirations of some of Virgil's iconic pieces and 
                slowly understand perhaps what Virgil and his team were thinking while creating his work. This I feel 
                truly shows that curiosity and willingness to dig deeper to expand your world knowledge that Gonchar was speaking upon.

            </div>
            <p><span class="first_letter">M</span>
                odals have been a long-standing staple of the internet world. We've all
                become very accustomed to them. However, our familiarity with modals doesn't 
                always come with a positive connotation. This is a key part of what the author, 
                Naema Baskanderi, addresses in their article <span class="blue">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays 
                / Dialog Windows </span>. Here, Baskanderi addresses the key flaws that we often see with 
                modals, which is the overuse in abruptly interrupting the user experience to bombard 
                you with popup-like information. As users, we have become too accustomed to dismissing 
                them immediately when the entire purpose of the modals should be to give us useful 
                information or help us accomplish a task.
                <br><br>
                I myself, relate to a lot of the points that Baskanderi brings up, as I've experienced 
                lots of poor uses of modals. However, I feel like I have learned a lot from this article 
                in how I can improve my use of modals in the future. One important point that is really 
                driven home throughout the article is to <span class="blue">avoid interrupting the user</span>. Everything must cater 
                to the user experience and must come from the user's intention. Some examples of this that 
                are brought up in the article are to ensure the modals are user-initiated and making your 
                buttons/title as helpful to the user so that they can accomplish the goal they were trying 
                to accomplish. The one that stood out to me was making sure the modal was escapable by 
                keyboard which is something I had not considered but can see how it would drastically 
                improve accessibility for users. Overall, I feel I have learned a lot from the article 
                which I will be implementing in my modals moving forward.

            <div>
                <h3 id="date">April 14, 2021</h3>
                <h3 id="author">Salim Ansari</h3>
            </div>
            <p><span class="first_letter">T</span>
                he article, 
                <span class="blue">"Best practices for form design"</span> 
                by Salim
                Ansari, goes into 20 tips to boost form usability. The tips cover a
                range of topics, ranging from input fields, placeholder text, and dropdown
                menus. Among all of these, the most common theme I saw was that often
                <span class="blue">"less is more"</span>. 
                <br><br>
                The tips that stood out to me were actually some that weren't completely
                obvious to me initially. For example, Ansari recommends that fields should
                be sized according to the input. My natural instinct would be to make all fields
                the same size in order to keep everything symmetrical. However, after reading
                Ansari's argument and looking at common websites that I use, I realized that
                fields such as zipcodes are easier to identify since I instinctively know that
                the field requires less characters. 
                <br><br>
                The other tip that stood out to me that I
                have also found myself doing often, is having crucial info as a placeholder
                text. Ansari points out that having crucial info as a placeholder creates a dilemma
                where the user can no longer see what the useful info is when they are typing and
                may have to delete the text in order to see the tip again which creates a lesser
                user experience.
                <br><br>
                Overall I feel that after reading Ansari's article, I have gained a lot of useful
                knowledge on how to improve the user experience for forms. As someone who has spent
                some time making websites, I have never taken into account all that goes into
                making good forms. After this, I will ensure that my forms are 
                <span class="blue">simpler</span> 
                and 
                <span class="blue">easier</span> 
                to navigate.
                <br><br>
                A website that I use very often is the clothing shop 
                <span class="blue"><a class="blue" href="https://www.cosstores.com">COS</a></span>.
                It incorporates many of these useful tips in their checkout form, which has appropriately
                sized input fields, crucial info below the input fields and not as placeholders, can
                easily tab between input fields, a progress bar to see how far along the form you are, and
                many of these other tips.
