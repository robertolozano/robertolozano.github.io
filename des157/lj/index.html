                uriosity is powerful. This is something that Gonchar drives home in their article "10 Intriguing 
                Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills" , where Gonchar lays out the importance of
                digging deeper and exploring all the tiny details. By doing this, one is able to learn a lot more about
                the world and extrapolate information that they would have otherwise missed. Thus Gonchar urges the reader
                to be curious and always be seeking out new ideas and expanding their view of the world by examining all
                the little details.
                <br><br>
                A site that I feel exemplifies this curiosity is the site by designer Virgil Abloh, <span class="blue">
                <a href="https://public---domain.com/" class="blue">public---domain</a></span>. In his site, he doesn't follow
                your typical layout for a website. Much like his designs, Virgil decides to break the what is considered the norm
                and decides to take his own spin on things. Instead its setup as a computers desktop with all sorts of information
                being presented to you. You have all sorts of windows open ranging from an interview to an image that links you
                to an article on Aya Brown. Furthermore since the website is set up like a desktop you can also explore the files on
                the computer, which invites you to just explore through the wide array of images, videos, and files. Through that journey
                of discovery you get to take a peek into the early designs or inspirations of some of Virgil's iconic pieces and
                slowly understand perhaps what Virgil and his team were thinking while creating his work. This I feel truly shows
                that curiosity and willingness to dig deeper to expand your world knowledge that Gonchar was speaking upon.

            </div>
            <p><span class="first_letter">M</span>
                odals have been a long-standing staple of the internet world. We've all
                become very accustomed to them. However, our familiarity with modals doesn't 
                always come with a positive connotation. This is a key part of what the author, 
                Naema Baskanderi, addresses in their article <span class="blue">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays 
                / Dialog Windows </span>. Here, Baskanderi addresses the key flaws that we often see with 
                modals, which is the overuse in abruptly interrupting the user experience to bombard 
                you with popup-like information. As users, we have become too accustomed to dismissing 
                them immediately when the entire purpose of the modals should be to give us useful 
                information or help us accomplish a task.
                <br><br>
                I myself, relate to a lot of the points that Baskanderi brings up, as I've experienced 
                lots of poor uses of modals. However, I feel like I have learned a lot from this article 
                in how I can improve my use of modals in the future. One important point that is really 
                driven home throughout the article is to <span class="blue">avoid interrupting the user</span>. Everything must cater 
                to the user experience and must come from the user's intention. Some examples of this that 
                are brought up in the article are to ensure the modals are user-initiated and making your 
                buttons/title as helpful to the user so that they can accomplish the goal they were trying 
                to accomplish. The one that stood out to me was making sure the modal was escapable by 
                keyboard which is something I had not considered but can see how it would drastically 
                improve accessibility for users. Overall, I feel I have learned a lot from the article 
                which I will be implementing in my modals moving forward.

            <div>
                <h3 id="date">April 14, 2021</h3>
                <h3 id="author">Salim Ansari</h3>
            </div>
            <p><span class="first_letter">T</span>
                he article, 
                <span class="blue">"Best practices for form design"</span> 
                by Salim
                Ansari, goes into 20 tips to boost form usability. The tips cover a
                range of topics, ranging from input fields, placeholder text, and dropdown
                menus. Among all of these, the most common theme I saw was that often
                <span class="blue">"less is more"</span>. 
                <br><br>
                The tips that stood out to me were actually some that weren't completely
                obvious to me initially. For example, Ansari recommends that fields should
                be sized according to the input. My natural instinct would be to make all fields
                the same size in order to keep everything symmetrical. However, after reading
                Ansari's argument and looking at common websites that I use, I realized that
                fields such as zipcodes are easier to identify since I instinctively know that
                the field requires less characters. 
                <br><br>
                The other tip that stood out to me that I
                have also found myself doing often, is having crucial info as a placeholder
                text. Ansari points out that having crucial info as a placeholder creates a dilemma
                where the user can no longer see what the useful info is when they are typing and
                may have to delete the text in order to see the tip again which creates a lesser
                user experience.
                <br><br>
                Overall I feel that after reading Ansari's article, I have gained a lot of useful
                knowledge on how to improve the user experience for forms. As someone who has spent
                some time making websites, I have never taken into account all that goes into
                making good forms. After this, I will ensure that my forms are 
                <span class="blue">simpler</span> 
                and 
                <span class="blue">easier</span> 
                to navigate.
                <br><br>
                A website that I use very often is the clothing shop 
                <span class="blue"><a class="blue" href="https://www.cosstores.com">COS</a></span>.
                It incorporates many of these useful tips in their checkout form, which has appropriately
                sized input fields, crucial info below the input fields and not as placeholders, can
                easily tab between input fields, a progress bar to see how far along the form you are, and
                many of these other tips.
