                he article, 
                <span class="blue">"Best practices for form design"</span> 
                by Salim
                Ansari, goes into 20 tips to boost form usability. The tips cover a
                range of topics, ranging from input fields, placeholder text, and dropdown
                menus. Among all of these, the most common theme I saw was that often
                <span class="blue">"less is more"</span>. 
                <br><br>
                The tips that stood out to me were actually some that weren't completely
                obvious to me initially. For example, Ansari recommends that fields should
                be sized according to the input. My natural instinct would be to make all fields
                the same size in order to keep everything symmetrical. However, after reading
                Ansari's argument and looking at common websites that I use, I realized that
                fields such as zipcodes are easier to identify since I instinctively know that
                the field requires less characters. 
                <br><br>
                The other tip that stood out to me that I
                have also found myself doing often, is having crucial info as a placeholder
                text. Ansari points out that having crucial info as a placeholder creates a dilemma
                where the user can no longer see what the useful info is when they are typing and
                may have to delete the text in order to see the tip again which creates a lesser
                user experience.
                <br><br>
                Overall I feel that after reading Ansari's article, I have gained a lot of useful
                knowledge on how to improve the user experience for forms. As someone who has spent
                some time making websites, I have never taken into account all that goes into
                making good forms. After this, I will ensure that my forms are 
                <span class="blue">simpler</span> 
                and 
                <span class="blue">easier</span> 
                to navigate.
                <br><br>
                A website that I use very often is the clothing shop 
                <span class="blue"><a class="blue" href="https://www.cosstores.com">COS</a></span>.
                It incorporates many of these useful tips in their checkout form, which has appropriately
                sized input fields, crucial info below the input fields and not as placeholders, can
                easily tab between input fields, a progress bar to see how far along the form you are, and
                many of these other tips.
